## Instructions

### Before you Start

1. Clear your workspace of any food or beverage. Although we are not working with any voltages that can cause harm, spilling stuff on them can damage the components.
2. Turn your potentiometers all the way to the left (counter-clockwise). This will keep your motors aligned with them before we provide power.
3. Install the Arduino development software on your computer. Follow the video instructions provided to you.
4. [Download the MiniRobotArmSketch](/assets/files/MiniRobotArmSketch.ino).

### Connecting Electronic Components

#### Step 1: Plug in Servo Motors

#### Step 3: Connect potentiometers to Arduino

**Note:** The potentiometers in the following pictures are turned upside down so you can see where the jumper wires connect.
